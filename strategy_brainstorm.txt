Mathematical literature published by everyone, read by everyone.

A mathematics education driven by curiosity and community, without economical limitations.

Take the power of math education back to the mathematicians.

Mathematics is as much an art as it is a tool.

IWM strategy?

Liberating math literature by simplifying creation and unrestricting publishing possibilities.

Creation is simplified by removing all obstacles except communicating mathematics.

Publishing is unrestricted by making all content accessible by everyone.
