<h1>About</h1>
<p>
My name is Sebastian Everett Eriksson. I'm a student, mentor and self-taught software developer.
</p>
<p>
Since 2012 I study civil engineering on Chalmers University of Technology,
currently aiming for a double degree as a high school teacher and engineer.
<p>
<p>
On my spare time I work voluntarily as a mentor in mathematics in 
<a href="http://www.intize.org">Intize</a>. 
Helping people develop themselves is my great passion.
</p>
<p>
I also do web development on my spare time, and I'm currently open for new jobs.

similar, you're welcome to check out which <a href="?q=services.html">services</a>
