<h1>Services</h1>
<p>
Here are the services I offer. If any of this interests you, you are free to 
<a href="?q=contact.html">contact</a> 
me about it and we'll work something out.
</p>
<p>
I live in <b>Gothenburg</b>, but during the summer I'm also available in <b>Stockholm</b>.
</p>

<h2>Web development</h2>
<p>
I offer paid web development. I specialize in websites that you or your organisation can <b>maintain by 
yourselves</b>, so that when I'm done the website remains informative and easy to navigate.
</p>
<p>
This requires that you <b>know your website</b>. My part is therefore merely getting the website running, 
then instructing you on how to fill it with content. I can also help with design choices.
</p>
<p>
Everything will of course be adapted to your own skills and needs.
</p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>
I offer teaching and mentorship during the summer, mainly in these areas:
<ul>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Web development and maintenance</li>
</ul>
Since physics and mathematics are school subjects I teach them for free. Programming is <b>free for 
women</b>, due to the lack of female programmers in the business.
